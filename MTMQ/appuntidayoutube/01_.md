# 1. Qubits and superpositions

The lecture can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWGCtsPGSXM)

This is the first lecture and it focuses on the very very basics of quantum computation for undergrads.

# 1.1 Introduction

First off, we define classical computers as using $0$ and $1$ in sequence to give measurments and store data.

You can imagine this at a macroscopic level as having a material with positive or negative charge, for instance.

However, if you scale everything down and make the system thermically isolated, it doesn't work the same way as you'd expect. The **states** you get are 1 and 0 *after* you measure, but before you do that they are in what is called a **superposition**.

> **Quantum states** are described in the following way:
>
> $$
> \ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}
> $$

To get a better intuitive understand, say we prepare a lot of different objects in a state $\ket{\psi}$, then, after we measure it, we won't get always the same answer, we could possibily get a few $0$ and a few $1$.

How do we then describe a state and what does the state mean?

Let us describe **normalized** states, where:

$$
\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}
\\ \ \\
\text{requiring } |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1
$$

Then we have the following:

$$
|\alpha|^2 = \text{Prob }(0)
\\ \ \\
|\beta|^2 = \text{Prob }(1)
$$

If we take these two parts and plot them in a $2d$ plane, then all possible points of a quantum state would sit on a circle, with radius $1$. That would be the **set of all measurments**.

### 1.1.1 Review of complex numbers

Let's call $z$ a **complex number**. We describe it as:

$$
z = x + iy \quad \text{where } i = \sqrt{-1}
$$

We also describe the following things:
- $i^2=-1$
- $x=\Re(z)$
- $y=Im(z)$

We also define the complex conjugation as:

$$
i \to -i
\\ \ \\
z^* = x-iy
$$

And we also define the  abosulte value as:

$$
|z| = \sqrt{z z^*}
\\ \ \\
|z|^2 = zz^* = (x+ iy)(x-iy) = x^2 + y^2
$$

## 1.2 Probabilities

Let's go a to the indentically prepared qubits, so we have a set of $N$ qubits with all $\ket{\psi}$ states.

After the measurments, we obtain $N_0$ $\ket{0}$ states, and $N_1$ $\ket{1}$ states.

What the probabilities mean, is that if we have:

$$
\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}
\\ \ \\
\text{For } N \to \infty
\\ \ \\
\lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{N_0}{N} = |\alpha|^2
\\ \ \\
\lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{N_1}{N} = |\beta|^2
$$

### 1.2.1 Representation of the state

Let's define a way to represent a state. A very useful way would be to write the following:

$$
\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}
\\ \ \\
\downarrow
\\ \ \\
\ket{\psi} \sim \begin{pmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{pmatrix}
$$

The last thing we wrote is the **representation of the state of a 2-level quantum system in a fixed basis** (as in a basis we know).

The **normalization** is:

$$
|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1
$$

An alternative way to write a state that takes into account the normalization atuomatically is:

$$
\ket{\psi} = e^{i\gamma} (\cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \ket{0} + e^{i\varphi} \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \ket{1})
$$

 So what we get is:

$$
\alpha = e^{i\gamma} \cos \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
 \\ \ \\
\beta = e^{i\gamma} e^{i\varphi} \sin \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
$$

Let us delve deeper into what this means. It all stems from the **Euler fomrula**:

$$
e^{i\lambda} = \cos (\lambda) + i \sin (\lambda)
\\ \ \\
\text{So we can write: }
\\ \ \\
Re(e^{i\lambda}) = \cos (\lambda)
\\ \ \\
Im(e^{i\lambda}) = \sin (\lambda)
$$

So then a consequence of this is:

$$
|e^{i\lambda}| = 1
$$

Since:

$$
z = e^{i\lambda}
\\
z^* = e^{-i\lambda}
\\ \ \\
zz^* = e^{i\lambda - i \lambda}= e^0  = 1
$$

We can also explain the probabilties and calculate them using the following:

$$
|\alpha|^2 = e^{i\gamma2} \cos \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)^2 e^{-i\gamma} = \cos \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)^2
\\ \ \\
|\beta|^2 = \sin \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)^2
\\ \ \\
\text{So we can write: }
\\ \ \\
|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = \cos^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) + \sin^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) = 1
$$

So the convinient way to write a state is:

$$
\ket{\psi} = e^{i\gamma} (\cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \ket{0} + e^{i\varphi} \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \ket{1})
$$

We however usually ignore the **overall phase factor** for a quantum state, because it does not **have important observable effects**. The relative phase, however, is important.

So a useful convention is having $\gamma = 0$ and writing:

$$
\ket{\psi} = \cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \ket{0} + e^{i\varphi} \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \ket{1}
$$

An useful way to represent this is by using the **Bloch sphere**, where the two variables represent the following:
- $\theta$ is the angle from the $z$ axis 
  - One can imagine it as: how far away from $\ket{0}$ we are
- $\varphi$ is the angle from the $x$ axis
  - Thisi is the phase, so its the angle of the vector in the $xy$ plane
  - You can imagine it as the sign inside the state.

# 2. Multiple Qubits and Tensor Products

The lecture can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_gZUj7EwDM)

## 2.1 Multiple Qubits

Having multiple qubits means that we have a system of $n$ qubits.

For instance, with $2$ qubits, we have the following possilbe states:

$$
\ket{00}, \ket{01}, \ket{10}, \ket{11}
$$

So the general state of a system of $2$ qubits is:

$$
\ket{\psi} = \alpha_{00} \ket{00} + \alpha_{01} \ket{01} + \alpha_{10} \ket{10} + \alpha_{11} \ket{11}
$$

With three qubits we have $8$ possible states, and so on.

We also want these to be normalized, so we have:

$$
|\alpha_{00}|^2 + |\alpha_{01}|^2 + |\alpha_{10}|^2 + |\alpha_{11}|^2 = 1
$$

Let's consider an example of a system of $2$ qubits and calculate one of the probabilities:

$$
\ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \ket{00} + \frac{1}{2} \ket{01} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \ket{10} + \alpha_{11} \ket{11}
$$

The probability of $|\alpha_{11}|^2$ is, when the state is normalized:

$$
|\alpha_{11}|^2 = 1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2
\\ \ \\
|\alpha_{11}|^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{5}
\\ \ \\
|\alpha_{11}|^2 = 1 - \frac{20 + 15 + 12}{60}
\\ \ \\
|\alpha_{11}|^2 = 1 - \frac{47}{60}
\\ \ \\
|\alpha_{11}|^2 = \frac{13}{60}
$$

So our $\alpha_{11}$ is:

$$
\alpha_{11} = e^{i\phi} \sqrt{\frac{13}{60}}
$$

For an arbitrary real $\phi$. (This phase factor does not have effects on the amplitude of this probability, but it does have effects on the relative phase of the state. For instance, if the phase is $0$, then the state is real, if it is $\pi$, then the state is imaginary, and so on. If the state is something in between, for instance $\pi/3$, then we get $\alpha_{11} = (1/2 + i\sqrt{3}/2) \cdot \sqrt{13/60}$).

## 2.2 Tensor Products

If we write something like $\ket{00}$ we imply that:

$$
\text{qubit A is in the state } \ket{0}_A
\\
\text{ AND }
\\
\text{qubit B is in the state } \ket{0}_B
$$

We can also write the states as:

$$
\ket{00} = \ket{0}_A \otimes \ket{0}_B
\\ \ \\
\ket{01} = \ket{0}_A \otimes \ket{1}_B
\\
\vdots
$$

If we consider two **isolated** qubit, each in a superposition of the type:

$$
\ket{\psi}_A = \alpha \ket{0}_A + \beta \ket{1}_A
\\ \ \\
\ket{\psi}_B = \gamma \ket{0}_B + \delta \ket{1}_B
$$

Then the combination is:

$$
\ket{\psi}_A \otimes \ket{\psi}_B = (\alpha \ket{0}_A + \beta \ket{1}_A) \otimes (\gamma \ket{0}_B + \delta \ket{1}_B)
\\ \ \\
= \alpha \gamma \ket{0}_A \otimes \ket{0}_B + \alpha \delta \ket{0}_A \otimes \ket{1}_B + \beta \gamma \ket{1}_A \otimes \ket{0}_B + \beta \delta \ket{1}_A \otimes \ket{1}_B
\\ \ \\
= \alpha \gamma \ket{00} + \alpha \delta \ket{01} + \beta \gamma \ket{10} + \beta \delta \ket{11}
$$

So what we can do is we can use the same representation as column vectors for the tensor product of the states:

$$
\ket{\psi}_A \sim \begin{pmatrix} \alpha_A \\ \beta_A \end{pmatrix}
\quad \text{ in } \{ \ket{0}_A, \ket{1}_A \} \text{ basis}
\\ \ \\
\ket{\psi}_B \sim \begin{pmatrix} \alpha_B \\ \beta_B \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{ in } \{ \ket{0}_B, \ket{1}_B \} \text{ basis}
\\ \ \\
\ket{\psi}_A \otimes \ket{\psi}_B \sim \begin{pmatrix} \alpha_A \alpha_B \\ \alpha_A \beta_B \\ \beta_A \alpha_B \\ \beta_A \beta_B \end{pmatrix}
\quad \text{ in } \{ \ket{00}, \ket{01}, \ket{10}, \ket{11} \} \text{ basis}
$$

Let's quickly explain a tensor product between two matrices. Suppose we have two matrices $A$ and $B$:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}
\\ \ \\
B = \begin{pmatrix} e & f \\ g & h \end{pmatrix}
$$

Then the tensor product is:

$$
A \otimes B = \begin{pmatrix} aB & bB \\ cB & dB \end{pmatrix}
\\ \ \\
= \begin{pmatrix} a e & a f & b e & b f \\ a g & a h & b g & b h \\ c e & c f & d e & d f \\ c g & c h & d g & d h \end{pmatrix}
$$

So the tensor product of two matrices is a block matrix, where each block is the product of the corresponding elements of the matrices.

### 2.2.1 Important difference

When we express a superposition state of two qubits with:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\alpha_{00} \\
\alpha_{01} \\
\alpha_{10} \\
\alpha_{11}
\end{pmatrix}
\quad \text{ in } 
\begin{pmatrix}
\ket{00} \\
\ket{01} \\
\ket{10} \\
\ket{11}
\end{pmatrix}
\text{ basis}
$$

We can express the "full width" of a "4d" vector.

However if we have the direct product of two qubit states, then we have:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\alpha_A \alpha_B \\
\alpha_A \beta_B \\
\beta_A \alpha_B \\
\beta_A \beta_B
\end{pmatrix}
$$

However, we cannot express all possible qubits with this. An exmaple would be the following:

$$
\ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{01} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{10}
$$

We can write this with the general form, but with the direct product of two states it is impossible to set separately $\alpha_A, \beta_A, \alpha_B, \beta_B$ to be able to represent this state.




# 3. Inner Products and Unitary trasnformation

The lecture can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbux8U1qwss)

## 3.1 Example

This first part focuses on an example, where we define a state as follows:

$$
\ket{\psi_1} = \cos \left( \frac{\theta_1}{2} \right) \ket{0} + e^{i\varphi_1} \sin \left( \frac{\theta_1}{2} \right) \ket{1}
\\ \ \\
\ket{\psi_2} = \cos \left( \frac{\theta_2}{2} \right) \ket{0} + e^{i\varphi_2} \sin \left( \frac{\theta_2}{2} \right) \ket{1}
\\ \ \\
\text{And we define:}
\\ \ \\
\ket{\psi} = \mathcal{N} \left( \ket{\psi_1}_A \otimes \ket{\psi_2}_B - \ket{\psi_2}_A \otimes \ket{\psi_1}_B  \right)
$$

What we are tasked to do is:
- Find $\mathcal{N}$
  - This is the **normalization facotor**
- Find the probability of getting $\ket{0}$ for the state of qubit $A$.

### 3.1.1 Solution

The first thing we do is expand out the state $\ket{\psi}$:

$$
\ket{\psi} = \mathcal{N} \left( \ket{\psi_1}_A \otimes \ket{\psi_2}_B - \ket{\psi_2}_A \otimes \ket{\psi_1}_B  \right)
\\ \ \\
= \mathcal{N} \left( \cos \left( \frac{\theta_1}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\theta_2}{2} \right) \ket{00} + e^{i\varphi_1} \sin \left( \frac{\theta_1}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\theta_2}{2} \right) \ket{01} + e^{i\varphi_2} \cos \left( \frac{\theta_1}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{\theta_2}{2} \right) \ket{10} + e^{i(\varphi_1 + \varphi_2)} \sin \left( \frac{\theta_1}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{\theta_2}{2} \right) \ket{11} \right. - \left. \cos \left( \frac{\theta_2}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\theta_1}{2} \right) \ket{00} - e^{i\varphi_2} \sin \left( \frac{\theta_2}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\theta_1}{2} \right) \ket{01} - e^{i\varphi_1} \cos \left( \frac{\theta_2}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{\theta_1}{2} \right) \ket{10} - e^{i(\varphi_1 + \varphi_2)} \sin \left( \frac{\theta_2}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{\theta_1}{2} \right) \ket{11} \right)
$$

Or something like that (i haven't checked the calulations and they are very long). The end result is, however:

$$
\ket{\psi} = \mathcal{N}\left( \cos \frac{\theta_1}{2} \sin \frac{\theta_2}{2} e^{i \phi_2} - \cos \frac{\theta_2}{2} \sin \frac{\theta_1}{2} e^{i \phi_1} \right) (\ket{01} - \ket{10})
$$

The normalization factor need to make it so that the state is normalized, so we have:

$$
\ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{01} - \ket{10})
$$

Which we can easly check is normalized.

So the probability of getting $\ket{0}$ for the state of qubit $A$ is:

$$
P(0) = \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}
$$

Lastly we can also, if we wanted to solve this in a different way, write the tensor product of the coefficients of the states.

## 3.2 Inner Products

Inner products for normal vector spaces are defined as follows:

$$
\vec{A} = a_X \hat{j} + a_Y \hat{j}
\\ \ \\
\vec{B} = b_X \hat{i} + b_Y \hat{j}
\\ \ \\
\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = a_X b_X + a_Y b_Y
$$

It has the property that:

$$
\vec{A} \cdot \vec{A} = |\vec{A}|^2
\\ \ \\
\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A}
\\ \ \\
\vec{A} \perp \vec{B} \implies \vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = 0
$$

### 3.2.1 Inner product for quantum states

For quantum states, we define the inner product as follows:

$$
\ket{\psi} = \sum_n \alpha_n \ket{n}
\\ \ \\
\ket{\phi} = \sum_n \beta_n \ket{n}
\\ \ \\
\braket{\psi | \phi} = \sum_n \alpha_n^* \beta_n
$$

And to respect the normalization, we have:

$$
\braket{\psi | \psi} = 1
$$

We can also infer the dual of $\ket{}$ as $\bra{}$, by using the state deifinitions of the coefficients as column vectors. So we have:

$$
\ket{\psi} = \begin{pmatrix} \alpha_1 \\ \alpha_2 \\ \vdots \end{pmatrix}
\\ \ \\
\bra{\psi} = \begin{pmatrix} \alpha_1^* & \alpha_2^* & \vdots \end{pmatrix}
$$

So we can write the inner product as:

$$
\braket{\psi | \phi} = \bra{\psi} \ket{\phi}
$$

So the following is true:

$$
\ket{\psi} = \sum_n \alpha_n \ket{n} \iff \bra{\psi} = \sum_n \alpha_n^* \bra{n}
$$

### 3.3 Unitary transformations

A unitary transformation is a transformation that we can apply to a quantum state.

$$
\ket{\psi} \to U \ket{\psi}
$$

Where $U$ is a matrix.

For instance we can define the following:

$$
\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}
\sim \begin{pmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{pmatrix}
\\ \ \\
U = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}
\\ \ \\
U \ket{\psi} = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \alpha + b \beta \\ c \alpha + d \beta \end{pmatrix}
$$

$U$ is unitary to preserve normalization.

But what does it mean to be unitary? We need to construct the hermitian conjugate of $U$:

$$
U \sim \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}
\\ \ \\
U^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} a^* & c^* \\ b^* & d^* \end{pmatrix}
$$

So we have:

$$
U U^\dagger = U^\dagger U = I
\\ \ \\
I = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

This is the definition of a **unitary matrix**. 

# 4. Projective Quantum Measurments

The lecture can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAYHA9GqYh0)

## 4.1 Projective Quantum Measurments

Basically the main point of this lecture is to explain how we can measure a quantum state.

After a measurment, the new state of the quantum system is the **projection** of the original state onto the basis of the measurment.

For instance, if we have a state $\ket{\psi}$ and we measure it in the basis $\{ \ket{0}, \ket{1} \}$, then the new state is:

$$
\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}
\\ \ \\
\text{Measurment: } \ket{0}
\\ \ \\
\text{New state: } \ket{0}
$$

For instance.

We also sometimes need to normalize the new state, so we have:

$$
\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}
\\ \ \\
\text{Measurment: } \ket{x}
\\ \ \\
\text{New state: } \frac{\ket{x}}{|\braket{x | \psi}|}
$$

Let's give another example:

$$
\ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{0} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{1}
\\ \ \\
\text{Measurment: } \ket{0}
\\ \ \\
\text{New state: } \sigma =\frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{0} + 0 \ket{1}}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} = \ket{0}
\\ \ \\
$$

### 4.1.1 Example

Let's suppose the 2-qubit system that is:

$$
\ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \ket{0_A0_B} + \frac{1}{2} \ket{01} + \sqrt{\frac{5}{12}}\ket{11}
\\ \ \\
\text{We check normalization: }
